# Set-Card-Game

A card game built using SwiftUI that challenges your logical reasoning skills. 
The deck for this game contains 81 unique cards with designs that vary over 4 features: number of shapes, shape, color, and shade. 
Each feature has three possibilities and the goal of the game is to form a set at every turn. 
A set consists of 3 cards where every feature must either be all the same or all different. 
This version is a single player mode where the player aims to maximize the number of sets found out of the laid out cards.
